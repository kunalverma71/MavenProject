<b>"I have been reading from a young age. I have read at every stage of my life and there has never been a time when I have not enjoyed it. I feel they are the most diligent teachers and pedantic counselors who help you throughout your life. They are the nicest friend, quietest and faithful. I feel the joy, the peace in reading and wanted to divvy up the joy with others. I trust the readers to help me grow the BooksWagon family."</b>- Kunal Verma, B.tech from MDU University, Rohtak
